<p style="font-size: 90%; text-align: justify; color:#303030; line-height: 1.4;"> 
    I am an <a href="https://philosophy-cognition.com/mcs/">MSc Cognitive Science</a> Student at the <a href="https://rub.de">Ruhr-Universität Bochum</a>, and am a student assistant with Neural and Behavioural data at the <a href="https://ini.rub.de">Institut für Neuroinformatik</a>, <a href="https://www.ini.rub.de/research/groups/computational_neuroscience/">Dynamics of Learning group.</a> I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology with a minor in Software Engineering from <a href="https://auca.kg">American University of Central Asia</a> and <a href="https://bard.edu">Bard College.</a> Currently, I am writing my master's thesis on systematic assessment of the effects of ICA-based
    artefact correction on multivariate pattern analysis of EEG data, under the supervision of Dr Laura-Isabelle Klatt at <a href="https://www.ifado.de/">IfADo.</a> <br>
    My research interests are related to computational and cognitive neuroscience of learning, working and episodic memory paradigms. I  experienced with EEG, intracranial EEG/LFP data analysis and machine learning. <br>
    I am attracted to interdisciplinary studies (i.e. combination of psychology and software engineering, or neuroscience and ML), and I believe that the best kind of science can only be made at the intersection of 2 or more fields.
