Rorschach Inkblot Method Analytics - or RIM analytics for short, was a web application that grew out from my interdisciplonary Bachelor thesis at the American University of Central Asia. The main goal of this project was to minimize the manual work of psychotherapists from weeks to minutes. Prior to this software, Russian-speaking psychotherapists in Kyrgyzstan using RIM for psychological assessment used to manually calculate metrics based on coded subjects' responses, and generate protocols in plain language based on quantification of these metrics. This manual work was taking up to 1 week to analyze the responses of just 1 subject. Doing this manually, also increases chances of human error. In contrast, RIM analytics takes no more than 1 second to compute all the metrics, and generate protocols in plain Russian language. This significantly accelerates the treatment, and allows psychotherapists to start actual work with the client at least 1 week sooner than with manual coding. The software was actively used as an educational tool in the Master's Programme of Applied Psychology at my alma mater.
